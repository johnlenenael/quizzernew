    hardQuestion: "An over-excited synchronous motor operates at what kind of power factor (leading or lagging)?",
    accept: ["leading"], answerText: "Leading power factor",
    question: "Which statement about an over-excited synchronous motor is correct?",
    choices: [
      "It operates at a lagging power factor",
